diff automatically identified the differences in the code, which made it easier to correct the error


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Easy access to old versions will make it easier to recover information that could otherwise become lost during repeated edits of a document.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Requiring manual commits puts responsibility on the user to commit regularly.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Git log lists all commts. git diff can compare differnences between any two commits.


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

having backups lowers the risk of losing important code or altering code to the point that it could be easily fixed.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Doing the first exercise for my ML course.
